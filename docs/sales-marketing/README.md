## Common Questions

**Q: Can we send the Legal Contract before procurement asks?**  
A: Yes, but only after interest is confirmed and they've read the Procurement ROI Document. Sending it too early can create unnecessary friction.

**Q: Should we always include the Founder's Promise?**  
A: Not always. Use it when:
- Customer explicitly asks about values/ethics
- Dealing with NGOs or mission-driven orgs
- Customer has concerns about vendor stability
- Cultural fit is critical to the sale

**Q: Can customers negotiate the ethical clauses?**  
A: No. Sections 1.3 (Human Judgment Primacy) and 8.4 (Ethical Termination) are non-negotiable. We can negotiate pricing, SLAs, and technical terms, but not core principles.

**Q: What if a customer wants to remove the "no recommendations" language?**  
A: That's a disqualifier. Politely explain that if they need recommendations, ContinuuAI isn't the right fit. Offer to help them find alternative vendors.
