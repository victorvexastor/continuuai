**Decision Continuity for Organizations That Hold Power Responsibly**

---

## The Problem

Your organization makes consequential decisions every quarter.  
Six months later, when those decisions matter again, the **why** has vanished.

**Not because of bad documentation.**  
Because documentation captures outcomes, not reasoning.

The result:
- Repeated mistakes
- Strategic drift
- Successor paralysis
- Quiet erosion of judgment

**Cost:** $500k - $5M per instance of decision reversal

---

## What We Do Differently

ContinuuAI preserves **decision reasoning**, not just decisions.

### Three Core Functions

**1. Recall**  
"What did we decide about X, and why?"  
→ Returns: Decision + rationale + dissent + uncertainty

**2. Reflection**  
"Are we contradicting past reasoning?"  
→ Surfaces: Patterns, drift, unexamined assumptions

**3. Projection**  
"What might we be missing?"  
→ Highlights: Similar past decisions, forgotten risks

---

## What We Don't Do (By Design)

❌ We don't make recommendations  
❌ We don't optimize behavior  
❌ We don't nudge decisions  
❌ We don't passively scrape data  
❌ We don't share your data across organizations

**We reflect. We don't direct.**

---

## Who This Is For

Organizations where:
- Decisions carry consequence
- Context matters more than speed
- Leadership feels responsibility
- Forgetting is expensive

**Ideal customers:**
- Mid-sized NGOs with regulatory exposure
- Health systems strategy teams
- Climate/energy transition firms
- Fintech risk & compliance units
- Government policy labs
- Scaling founder-led companies (200-500 staff)

---

## Real Value (Conservative)

### Scenario: One Prevented Decision Reversal
**Cost of rework:** $500k - $5M  
**ContinuuAI annual cost:** $120k  
**ROI:** 4x - 42x

### Scenario: One Executive Transition
**Cost of context loss:** $300k - $1.5M  
**ContinuuAI impact:** Successor inherits thinking, not just outcomes  
**ROI:** 2.5x - 12x

### Scenario: One Compliance Incident (Partial Mitigation)
**Potential cost:** $1M - $50M  
**ContinuuAI value:** Auditable decision rationale  
**ROI:** 8x - 416x

---

## How It Works

### 1. Record (Intentional, Not Passive)
Key decisions logged with:
- What was decided
- Why (tradeoffs, constraints)
- Who dissented (preserved, not erased)
- What was uncertain

**Time investment:** <1 hour/week for executive team

---

### 2. Query (Natural Language)
"What did we decide about patient data access?"

**Response:**
> "In 2019, you chose progressive disclosure over full access. Primary concern: overwhelming patients with clinical terminology. Security team expressed concern about paternalism but agreed after pilot feedback. In 2024, you reconsidered during portal project but didn't revisit pilot data."

---

### 3. Reflect (Pattern Detection)
Quarterly reviews surface:
- Contradictions across time
- Assumption drift
- Repeated patterns
- Preserved dissent

**No judgment. Just visibility.**

---

## Technical Overview

**Architecture:**
- Cloud-hosted (SOC 2 Type II)
- SSO integration (SAML/OAuth)
- Role-based access control
- End-to-end encryption

**Data:**
- Customer owns 100% of data
- Zero cross-customer data usage
- Export anytime (JSON format)
- Deleted within 30 days of termination

**Compliance:**
- GDPR compliant
- CCPA compliant
- Audit-ready logging

---

## Pricing

**$10,000/month** ($120,000 annual)

**Why this price?**  
One prevented decision reversal pays for 4-42 years of service.

**90-Day Pilot Available:** $30,000 (credited if continued)

---

## What Makes This Unusual

Most AI tools want you to:
- Use them constantly
- Depend on their recommendations
- Give them all your data

**ContinuuAI is designed for:**
- Moments of consequence (not constant use)
- Supporting judgment (not replacing it)
- Intentional recording (not passive surveillance)

**Result:** Boring, slow, and ethical.  
Also: durable, trustworthy, and genuinely useful.

---

## Implementation

### Week 1-2: Alignment
- Confirm executive sponsor
- Identify first decision stream
- Security review

### Week 3-4: Setup
- SSO integration
- User onboarding (4 hours exec, 2 hours team)
- First decisions recorded

### Day 30: First Value
- Query past decisions
- Surface first pattern

### Day 90: Go/No-Go
- Evaluate: Is this useful or overhead?
- Continue, adjust, or terminate (no penalty)

## The Ethical Commitment

**If at any point the system reduces your team's ability to think independently, you should stop using it.**

That's in the contract.

We're not building dependency. We're building support.

---

## Case Study: Health System Strategy Team

**Problem:** Repeated $800k rework on patient portal (forgot 2019 decision)

**ContinuuAI Impact:** Surfaced original reasoning before redesign started

**Result:**
- Zero rework
- 3-month timeline saved
- Board confidence improved

**Quote:**  
*"This isn't about being faster. It's about not punishing ourselves for forgetting."*  
— CSO, 2,500-employee health system

## The Sentence That Matters

**"ContinuuAI costs less than the mistakes organizations make when they forget why they chose what they chose."**

That's it.

## Appendix: What We Refuse to Build

We maintain a public list of features we will **never** add, regardless of revenue pressure:

1. **Decision scoring or ranking** (suppresses uncertainty)
2. **Automated recommendations** (collapses responsibility)
3. **Behavioral nudging** (bypasses consent)
4. **Passive surveillance** (destroys trust)
5. **Cross-organization learning** (violates boundaries)

**Why publish this?**  
So you know our constraints are structural, not aspirational.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why not just improve our documentation?**  
A: Documentation captures *what*. ContinuuAI preserves *why*, including dissent and uncertainty. No one reads 30-page post-mortems. ContinuuAI makes reasoning queryable.

**Q: Can't we do this with AI tools we already have?**  
A: Most AI tools optimize for answers and speed. ContinuuAI optimizes for continuity and preserved context. Different purpose, different design.

**Q: What if leadership changes?**  
A: That's exactly the scenario we protect against. New leaders inherit reasoning, not just outcomes.

**Q: What if we don't use it enough?**  
A: Like insurance, value comes from availability at moments of consequence, not constant usage. Typical usage: 10-30 queries and 10-15 decisions recorded per quarter.

**Q: What happens to our data if we leave?**  
A: You export everything (JSON format, no charge). We delete all data within 30 days. Certified deletion provided.

**Q: Can you add [feature]?**  
A: Maybe. But if it violates our ethical constraints (see Appendix), no. We choose fewer customers and deeper integrity.

If it doesn't, we're not the right fit—and that's okay.
