## Opening (0:00 - 3:00)

**Alex:** Sarah, thank you for making time. Before we talk about anything we've built, I need to know whether this problem actually exists for you. If it doesn't, we shouldn't continue.

**Sarah:** [pause] Okay, I appreciate the directness.

**Alex:** Do important decisions in your organization lose context over time in a way that causes repeated mistakes, drift, or quiet risk?

**Sarah:** [long pause] Yes. Absolutely. We just had this conversation last month in our exec team. We launched a patient portal initiative that... honestly, it was almost identical to one we abandoned in 2019. Different team, same mistakes.

**Alex:** What happened when you realized it?

**Sarah:** We were six months in. Had to completely redesign the access model because the original reasoning—which was actually sound—had been lost. Cost us probably $800k in rework and another three months.

**Alex:** And the 2019 decision—was it documented?

**Sarah:** Oh yes. [laughs] Beautifully documented. Thirty-page post-mortem. No one read it.

**Alex:** Right. That's the problem we're addressing.

## Reframing (3:00 - 10:00)

**Alex:** Most AI tools focus on answers. We focus on continuity—what you decided, why, and what changed afterward.

**Sarah:** So you're like... institutional memory?

**Alex:** More specifically: decision memory. When a decision from a year ago comes back to matter, how do you reconstruct the reasoning behind it today?

**Sarah:** [sighs] We don't, really. We have notes, we have decks, but the *why*—the actual tradeoffs, the things we were worried about, the dissent that got smoothed over in the final recommendation—that's gone.

**Alex:** And when that context is missing?

**Sarah:** We either make it up based on what seems logical now, or we just... repeat the cycle. Which is what happened with the portal.

**Alex:** Has this created any other issues beyond direct rework costs?

**Sarah:** Yes. Two things: First, our exec turnover means every new leader inherits outcomes without reasoning. They spend six months reverse-engineering decisions before they can move forward. Second, our board keeps asking us why we're not learning faster. And honestly? We don't have a good answer.

---

## The Boundary Statement (10:00 - 12:00)

**Alex:** I want to be explicit: We do not optimize people's behavior. We do not nudge decisions. We do not try to make users dependent.

**Sarah:** [pause] Wait, isn't that the whole point of AI tools? To make us faster?

**Alex:** That's the point of most AI tools. ContinuuAI has a different purpose. If you're looking for an AI that tells people what to do faster, this won't be a fit.

**Sarah:** [thoughtful] Okay... keep going.

**Alex:** We believe speed without continuity is just expensive iteration. What we do is preserve how your organization thinks over time—not to control it, but to make it visible.

**Sarah:** I'm listening.

---

## Core Explanation (12:00 - 25:00)

**Alex:** ContinuuAI is a private system that preserves how your organization thinks over time—not just documents, but decisions, assumptions, tradeoffs, and dissent. It reflects patterns back to you so people can see when they're repeating something, contradicting themselves, or drifting from stated priorities. It doesn't recommend actions. It makes reasoning visible.

**Sarah:** Give me a concrete example.

**Alex:** Six months from now, someone on your team is designing a new patient data access policy. They ask ContinuuAI: "What did we decide about patient data access in the past, and why?" 

ContinuuAI returns: "In 2019, you chose progressive disclosure over full access. The primary concern was overwhelming patients with clinical terminology. Three stakeholders expressed concern about paternalism but agreed after pilot feedback. In 2024, you reconsidered this during the portal project but hadn't revisited the original pilot data."

**Sarah:** [pause] So it would have told us we were repeating ourselves?

**Alex:** Not quite. It would have shown you what you decided before, the reasoning, and what had changed. You still make the call—but with full context.

**Sarah:** That's... actually exactly what we needed.

**Alex:** Here's what's important: ContinuuAI doesn't just store the decision. It preserves the *uncertainty* and the *dissent*. Because those are often the most valuable parts.

**Sarah:** We definitely have dissent. [laughs] Can you give me an example of how that works?

**Alex:** Let's say your security team wanted stricter access controls, but your patient experience team wanted ease of use. Both are valid. Most systems force resolution and the losing argument disappears. ContinuuAI preserves both positions—so six months later, when access control becomes an issue, you remember that your security team called this.

**Sarah:** That would have saved us in about four situations I can think of.

---

## Qualification Question (25:00 - 28:00)

**Alex:** Let me ask you something important: Who in your organization would be uncomfortable with a system that preserves decision rationale instead of letting it fade?

**Sarah:** [long pause] Probably... honestly, some of our executives. The ones who prefer decisiveness over deliberation.

**Alex:** That's a good sign, actually.

**Sarah:** Really?

**Alex:** The discomfort usually means the system would surface real things. If everyone's comfortable, it often means there's nothing controversial enough to matter.

**Sarah:** Huh. That's a different way to think about it.

**Alex:** The question is: Do you have executive support for making decision-making more transparent to yourselves?

**Sarah:** I believe so. Our CEO has been pushing for exactly this kind of rigor. He came from a regulated environment and keeps saying we're "playing faster than we're learning."

**Alex:** That's the signal we look for.

---

## Commercial Framing (28:00 - 35:00)

**Alex:** We work with a small number of organizations. Pricing is monthly, five figures, because this replaces real risk, not software licenses.

**Sarah:** [pause] Five figures monthly is... significant. Help me understand the value equation.

**Alex:** Before we discuss specific numbers, I want to know: if this existed today, where would it reduce harm or waste first?

**Sarah:** [thinking] Three places immediately. First, our architecture decisions—we keep revisiting fundamental choices because no one remembers why we made them. Second, our compliance decisions—we have turnover in that group and every new person questions existing risk tolerances. Third, our product strategy—we contradict ourselves across quarters and don't realize it until customers point it out.

**Alex:** Conservative estimate: what does one instance of architectural rework cost you?

**Sarah:** Conservatively? $500k to $1.5m when you factor in engineering time, opportunity cost, and morale.

**Alex:** And how often does that happen?

**Sarah:** At least twice a year. Sometimes more.

**Alex:** So you're looking at $1-3 million in direct costs annually, plus the intangible costs of team frustration and customer confusion.

**Sarah:** [pause] Yes. When you put it that way...

**Alex:** ContinuuAI is $10,000 per month. $120,000 annually. If it prevents one major rework, it pays for itself ten times over.

**Sarah:** That's a compelling ratio. What's the catch?

## Addressing the Unspoken (35:00 - 38:00)

**Alex:** The catch is that it won't make you faster in the short term. It might actually slow you down slightly—because you'll see your contradictions more clearly.

**Sarah:** [laughs] That's honest.

**Alex:** We're not selling speed. We're selling reduced waste and clearer thinking. Those aren't the same thing.

**Sarah:** What does implementation look like?

**Alex:** We start with a 90-day pilot focused on one decision stream—in your case, probably architecture or product strategy. You record decisions as they happen. After 90 days, we evaluate whether the system is actually useful or just adding overhead.

**Sarah:** And if it's not useful?

**Alex:** We stop. You keep your data, we part ways cleanly, no penalties.

**Sarah:** You're very willing to walk away.

**Alex:** We only work with organizations where this genuinely solves a problem. Anywhere else, it's friction pretending to be value.

---

## Close (38:00 - 42:00)

**Sarah:** What do I need to do to move forward?

**Alex:** Three things: First, confirm executive buy-in—I'd want a 30-minute call with your CEO to make sure we're aligned. Second, identify your first decision stream for the pilot. Third, assign an internal sponsor who has authority and cares about this problem.

**Sarah:** I can do all of that. The CEO will want to talk to you anyway.

**Alex:** One more thing: If at any point during the pilot it feels like it's reducing human judgment instead of supporting it, we stop. That's in the contract.

**Sarah:** [pause] That's unusual.

**Alex:** Our goal isn't adoption. It's usefulness. If it's not useful, it shouldn't exist.

**Sarah:** I need to bring this to our exec team next week. Can you send me something I can share?

**Alex:** I'll send you a one-page overview and the pilot structure. But I'd recommend framing it as a decision continuity system, not an AI tool. The AI is infrastructure. The value is continuity.

**Sarah:** That's exactly how I'll position it. Let's talk next week after I've run it past the team.

**Alex:** Sounds good. And Sarah—thank you for the honesty about your challenges. That helps us understand if we're the right fit.

**Sarah:** This is the most unusual sales call I've had in years. But I think that's a good thing.

## What Made This Call Work

1. **Qualification first** - Started with "does this problem exist?" not "here's our solution"
2. **Real pain surfacing** - Let Sarah articulate the cost in her own words
3. **Boundary clarity** - Explicitly stated what we don't do
4. **Value framing** - Positioned against avoided cost, not gained efficiency
5. **Mutual respect** - Treated Sarah as intelligent buyer, not target to be closed
6. **Exit safety** - Made it easy to walk away, which built trust

This is not a transactional sale. It's the beginning of a partnership with an organization ready to think differently about decision-making.
